# Hierarchical matrix toolbox
The <code>hm-toolbox</code> is a toolbox implementing the arithmetic of H-matrices in MATLAB. 
Only the simplest case of the so-called HODLR matrices is handled, where the partitioning
is recursively done in 2 x 2 blocks, and the off-diagonal blocks are of low-rank. 

This can be used to represent quasiseparable matrices.
